## Summary of the Tech Stack
This sample page was built using basic HTML, and some intermediate CSS. I imported the required fonts from the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), and the necessary images and icons were provided by [devChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/) themselves. For desiging the grid-like structure of team members and their roles, I have used [CSS Grid](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp), and using [media queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) I made the design responsive. Along with this I used [GitHub](https://github.com/boseriddha/my_team_devChallenges) to give the webpage a repository of its own, and used [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) to host the webpage. 

## Design
The design was provided by [devChallenges](devchallenges.io) using Figma files. Here are the design files -> [click me!](https://www.figma.com/proto/F8d1qJsorEdY47N74HLxQ4/team-page-challenge?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=1%3A2&viewport=241%2C48%2C0.67&scaling=min-zoom).
